# Resume Telnet Server

This is a novel Node.js telnet server that I built to both get my feet wet with Node.js,
and to serve my resume. To connect to the demo server, open up a terminal and enter the
following:

```
telnet resume.zacharyflower.com 2468
```

## Configuration

The resume sections are dynamically generated via a required `config.js` file.
An example configuration file (`config-sample.js`) has been provided.

### Port

Update the `port` value to change the port the resume server listens on. Ports
below 1024 will require root access.

### MotD

The `motd` (or Message of the Day) value is used to generate the ASCII-art name
displayed when someone connects to the resume server.

                                  |___/
```

## Usage

To run your server, clone this repository and run the following commands from within the directory:

```
npm install
node server.js
```

To keep your server running in the background, check out https://github.com/foreverjs/forever,
an awesome command-line tool for running node packages continuously.

## Server Commands

### Resume / CV

View entire resume.

```
resume
```

### Help

View help screen.

```
help
```

### Exit / Quit

Quit out of the resume.

```
exit
```

## What's Next?

Just a few ideas on how I can improve the server:

- Pull down job history, awards, etc. from a LinkedIn profile instead of
  duplicating the data within a config file.
- Roll this into an actual node package for `npm install` goodness.
- Configure forever-monitor for built-in daemon support.
- Add analytics to track number of views.
- Add ability to set resume to private w/ password protection.
